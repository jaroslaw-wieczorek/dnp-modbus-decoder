			-NOTES ON DJANGO DEVELOPMENT-

	Basic example: mysite(head)->polls

-----IMPORTANT COMMANDS-----
Starting a project-
django-admin.py startproject MY_PROJECT

Create an application and its basic files
python manage.py startapp MY_APP

Create database tables as specified in settings.py-
python manage.py syncdb
(Re-run this command to remake database tables after you make changes to their design)

Convert python database basics into SQL automatically
python manage.py sql MY_APP

--QUESTIONS--
Group- Are we shooting for one page with tabs or multiple pages?
	-Probably depends on what I find

--LOOK INTO LATER--
Django comes with a default "collapse" class for hiding unnecesssary information

They're talking about templates, so maybe use one to design the look of the site?
