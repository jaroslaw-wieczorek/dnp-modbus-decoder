I would appreciate it if each of you could answer the following questions via email at least 1 day prior to the green sheet meeting.  We will use the answers to these questions to guide the meeting and know what topics we need to get deeper into during the meeting.

•  The work you completed that week and the plan for the next week
•	Any breaks from working on the project for longer than 1 week (vacation, finals, summer, busy week, etc.)
•	What are your next deliverables?  When are they due?  Do you see any problems getting them complete?  If yes, please describe.
•	Do you see any budget problems given the amount of work you have left?  If yes, please describe. (I know you don’t have a “budget” for this project but it is something to think about)
•	List of “blockers”…anything that is preventing you from accomplishing your work.  Unanswered RFIs, a prerequisite deliverable, a back check, etc.  Please name names here.  This won’t be used to place blame on anyone, I am just trying to determine if there is a problem and how to fix it.
•	Any other issues that we need to talk about…technical topics that need more instruction might be an example
•	Any potential Work Scope Variances (WSVs)
